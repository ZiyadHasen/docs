# useState

Let's start our discussion by refreshing our memory on **Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference** in JavaScript.

## **Pass by Value**

Primitive values (`boolean`, `number`, `string`, `undefined`, `null`) are passed directly. In other words, the data is copied and assigned to another variable, making them independent.

The reason is that these data types are small (64-bit) and stored in the **stack**, which is fast and efficient. Copying them has **negligible memory/performance cost**. So, it's like saying, "Why not be generous if the cost is almost nothing?"

```js
let a = 10;
let b = a; // Copy the value of 'a' into 'b'
b = 20; // Changing 'b' doesn't affect 'a'
console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
```

## **Pass By Reference**

For non-primitive data types (`array`, `object`), variables store a **reference** to the memory location of the object, not the object itself. The cost of copying these is large, so instead, we **pass by reference**.

Objects and arrays are stored in the **heap**, a larger memory pool, because they can grow dynamically and hold more data.

```js
let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1; // Both reference the same object
obj2.name = "Bob"; // Changing obj2 affects obj1
console.log(obj1.name); // "Bob"
```

Now, how does this relate to `useState` in React? Let's dive in.

## **React Embraces Immutability**

### **What is immutability?**

Immutability means **data cannot be changed directly**. Instead of modifying the original object or value, you create a **new version** with the desired changes.

### **How React Works in Terms of Updates**

- Each React **component** is like a node in the **virtual DOM tree**.
- React re-renders a component **only if it detects a change** in:
  - **Props**: Data passed down from parent components.
  - **State**: Internal data managed within the component.
- React relies on **reference comparison** (_shallow comparison_):
  - **Primitives:** Directly compare values (e.g., `42 !== 43`).
  - **Objects/Arrays:** Compare references (e.g., `prevObj !== nextObj`).

```js
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "Alice" });

user.name = "Bob"; // Mutate the original object
setUser(user); // React doesn't detect a change
```

React **doesn't detect the change** because:

- **Shallow comparison of references:**
  React checks if the `user` reference has changed.
  Since the reference is the same, React assumes no change and skips the re-render.

```jsx
prevUser === nextUser; // true, because you didn't create a new object
```

### **How to Ensure React Detects Changes**

To signal a change, create a new object with updated values:

```jsx
setUser({ ...user, name: "Bob" }); // Create a new object
prevUser !== nextUser; // true, React detects the change and re-renders
```

### **Why Immutability is Necessary**

- React **listens for reference changes**, not deep changes inside the object.
- Direct mutation hides the change from React because:
  - The reference (`user`) stays the same.
  - React doesnâ€™t do a deep comparison (too slow for performance).
- **"Copy + Update" = Immutability**: Always create a fresh version of the data instead of modifying the original.
- **React's Optimized Listening**: React isn't spying on every field inside your objects. It listens to the object reference itself.

For **primitive data types**, even a shallow comparison catches the change since it directly compares values.

### **Each Component Has Its Own State Reference**

Every instance of a component gets its **own** separate state with its own reference. This means they **work independently**.

## **Example: Managing State in a List**

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function List() {
  const [list, setList] = useState(["john", "mary", "kate"]);
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  const addName = () => {
    // Both of these will trigger a re-render: value change and reference change
    setList([...list, name]);
    setName("");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {list.map((name) => (
          <li key={name} className="text-red-400">
            {name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={addName}>Add Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return <List />;
}

export default App;
```

React listens to **both** state changes (`list` and `name`), but it will re-render **once** because React batches state updates.

```js
setList([...list, name]); // Reference change: Create a new list with added name
setName(""); // Clears the input field
```
